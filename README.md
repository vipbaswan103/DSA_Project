# RAM and Defragmentation simultaion using arrays in C
This project was submitted for the partial fullfillment of course completion requirements of Data Structures and Algoritms at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus.
The main objectives of the project are to learn:
1) How objects and pointers are implemented in RAM
2) How defragmentation is done

## Getting Started
1) Downlaod ```driver.c```, ```list.c```, ```list.h``` and ```Makefile```
2) Open terminal and run the makefile as:
```
make
```
This will compile and run the executable.
3) Follow the instruction in the code

## Prerequisites
A C/C++ compiler is sufficient to run the code. Though the code has been developed using ```gcc 7.3.0``` compiler (in Linux Environment), it can be run on ```MinGW``` too.

## Built With
1) ```vim```
2) ```gcc 7.3.0 compiler```
